Time to fight all the baddies one line at a time.

In order to become the coder I want to become I need lots of experience; and so with this git repository starts my journey. I hope to complete many projects, and learn how to overcome some of most difficult obstacles. Remember:

>   It doesn't matter where you start, but that you start, and that you keep going.

Although I haven't made any changes here I have most certainly been coding. I still have not forgotten my words, [ASSERT_game](https://github.com/ASSERT-game) is a link to the projects I have been working on. They range from chess, to PacMan to attempts at a rendering engine.

Heart of the Code.

### July 17, 2020:
Still have not forgotten my words. Continuing to code, wonder how far I will get on my current project [JELLYFISH](https://github.com/aquaviverium). I don't think I will finish it anytime soon, or that I currently have the skills to finish it how I want, but I have to start somewhere. Hopefully I will have time to revisit this project when I have become a better coder. I'm also begining to wonder how many lines of code I have written up to date, hopefully I write many with this current project.

### March 9, 2021:
I have not forgotten, I am still coding. I have made various games too since I last was here! I did end up making tic tac toe, and even an AI that I can't beat! Heck I even made pacman, twice! The second one looks pretty good, and is fairly extensible. Mainly have been building some tools in SDL allowing me to create games faster and it has snowballed from there. Also coded over 5,000 lines of C code for Advent of Code! I should make a program to count how many lines I have actually written amoung all my github repos.

As before one line at a time!

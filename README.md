Time to fight all the baddies one line at a time.

In order to become the coder I want to become I need lots of experience; and so with this git repository starts my journey. I hope to complete many projects, and learn how to overcome some of most difficult obstacles. Remember:

>   It doesn't matter where you start, but that you start, and that you keep going.
